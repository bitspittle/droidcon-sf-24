## CMP for Web vs Compose HTML

### Why Compose HTML?

* No need to create a large canvas buffer
* UI can be inspected by browser devtools
* Some styling is only available via CSS (e.g. visited links, print mode)
* Browser accessibility support is robust and well-established.
* Smaller site download size
* Access to JS frameworks
