## Why did I create Kobweb?

### Live Reloading

{{{ LiveReloadingIndicator }}}

{{{ SpeakerNotes

* Despite no preview window, live reloading works well enough
* If you change code, the spinner will run and reload when the build is finished (or show you a failed indicator) 
* Live reloading built from the ground up (many projects add as an afterthought)
* We'll talk about fullstack later, but even server side logic can be reloaded automatically while developing
